- myblocksadmin -


SUMMARY:

This files add blocks admin into your module.


BACKGROUND:

XOOPS's admin of blocks and groups will be hard to use,
when many modules is installed.
If each module has the block management screen for itself,
webmasters using XOOPS will feel it easy, I think.
I will recommend it to the module developers by all means.


HOW TO USE:

1) copy these 3 files into XOOPS_ROOT_PATH./modules/(your module)/admin/
2) edit admin/menu.php and add a menu item like this:

	$adminmenu[] = array( 'title' => _MI_SYSTEM_ADMENU2 ,
	                      'link' => "admin/myblocksadmin.php" ) ;

That's all !



CHANGELOG:

2003-12-18 0.03 for XOOPS <= 2.0.3 patch
                (gperm_handler->deleteByModule() has only 1 parameter)
2003-12-12 0.02 'module_read' and 'module_admin' to be able to change
2003-12-4  0.01 first release
