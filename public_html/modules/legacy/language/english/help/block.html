<h4>How to use Blocks?</h4>
<p>Blocks are installed with modules to display a specific data</p>
<p>For example, a module to manage articles will provide a block to display the "Most Popular", and another block to display the "Most Recent", etc.</p>
<p>But you can also create a custom block with your content</p>>

<h5>Install Blocks</h5>
<p>At first, you have to install blocks to display in your website<br />
<a href="<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/legacy/admin/index.php?action=BlockInstallList">Click here</a> to start installing blocks.<br />
The form fields are quite intuitive, you can change the name of the block and set groups permissions to see the block<br />
But also define the order of display, the column and specify modules.</p>

<h5>Column</h5>
<p>Most themes have a classic 3 column layout with a center column for the main content also split into three center columns.<br />
These are called : Left column, Center-Left column, Center column, Center-right column and Right column.<br />
But you can select a classic two columns for your weblog or web gallery.<br />
You can design and display the block to any column and specify the target module.</p>

<p>Some themes don't have Left column nor Right column.<br />
In such case, one column might be inseted to another column.<br />
Read the manual of those themes to understand how they are designed.</p>

<h5>Block Management</h5>
<p>You can change the settings of a block at anytime from Block Management. <a href="<{$smarty.const.XOOPS_MODULE_URL}>/legacy/admin/index.php?action=BlockList">Click here</a>.<br />
Click the edit icon to change the block settings. Sometimes a block has extra options to control its content.</p>

<h6>Uninstall Block</h6>
<p>If you want to remove a block from your layout, click the uninstall icon.<br />
The block returns into the list of uninstalled blocks.<br />
The settings of the block are kept until you uninstall its module.<br />
You can re-install the block at anytime.</p>

<h5>FOR XOOPS2 USERS</h5>
<p>XOOPS Cube Legacy 2.2 has separated the list of un-used blocks from Block Management.<br />
It is like Module Management.</p>
