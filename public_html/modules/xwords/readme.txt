Introduction:
-------------
Thanks for giving Wordbook an opportunity to serve you. This little module has a single purpose: to help you build in your site a nice glossary, one in which you can choose to have a single category or many categories (glossaries).

This module was built using XOOPS 2.0.6 as test bed, and includes syntax that will probably need a not-too-old version of PHP. It's based on Soapbox, in turn based on Catzwolf's module called WF-FAQ, with many, many changes. But it does have a couple of good features: it uses Smarty templates and it's fully searchable (it even includes its own search function).

This document is short because, as its predecessor, Wordbook includes a LARGE help file. In fact, most of the module's weight is due to the inclusion of this help file, which can be accessed through a button in the admin side. If you want a leaner module, just leave the help folder out of your upload and keep it handy to have local access to the help. Just remember that you won't have it available while online.

How to install
--------------
Wordbook is installed as a regular XOOPS module, which means you should copy the complete /wordbook folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Wordbook icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

For a complete description of the module and its features, you can use the included help file. Access it directly in yoursite/modules/wordbook/help/index.html or else use the 'Help' button in the admin side of the module. If you prefer NOT to include the help file on your server, simply open the directory "Help" on your local machine and open "index.html" in your browser.
