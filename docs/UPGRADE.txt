** NEVER UPLOAD all archive's files to your server!! **

Basically, the archive includes all files if a file has been updated.
Therefore, if you upload all files from the archive to your server,
your server files will be overwritten.

First, remove the following directory & file from the archive.

- /install
- /mainfile.php

Next, upload all files to your server.

Lastly, in the module management of the admin control panel, 
update all modules which show a red-color and , or an update icon.
