<h4>Help</h4>
<p>The XCL bundle includes advanced search functionality and built-in help for each module.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>The XOOPSCube Project has remained simple, secure and scalable web application, twenty years after its first development to extend XOOPS2. After this date, on April 20, 2024 XOOPSCube 2.4.0 users will no longer receive updates.
</p>
<h4>Options for Integrators</h4>
<p>Itâ€™s crucial to emphasize the importance of maintaining a secure software environment. Therefore, XOOPSCube 2.4.0 does not include X-Update Manager notifications. For those interested in using the latest, secure version of XContainer, reach out to us regarding obtaining an enterprise license.
